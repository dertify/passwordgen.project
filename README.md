# passwordgen.project
This is one of my first projects.
I build this project because I was bored and I thought it would be a great idea.
What it basically does, it ask you for a password length and if the length is inbetween 15 and 25 it will return a random generated password
Also if you really want you can use the password, it isn't stored anywhere.
